First Modification to be done:
    [Bad design/Naming convetion]
1. Make a copy cat of data_access.py. Name the class (on purpose) as DataAccess 
[Activity] Let the students attempt this OOP refactoring first

--> Does this feel right? 
    - for the time being we have one source of data to access (users table), what if we start to having more tables?
    - Plus, we are currently using only one type of data format (JSON), 
    what do you think would happen if we introduce some SQL tables/files? or if we completely migrated to SQL?
